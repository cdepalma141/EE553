 HW1f - Mystery Sum

/*
 In order to be able to see past 5 decimal places when using double I use setprecision() from the iomanip library.
 I found this on a cplusplus.com forum.

 the first part that is commented out is the test i use to determine how big i could make N while using float.  I was able to get N up to 4090
 before the number stopped changing. The value was 1.644725.
